Hi! I'm Kshitij, a firmware engineer at [Tor.ai](https://tor.ai/), an IIoT company based in Pune, Maharashtra. Originally from Mumbai (the city that never sleeps) I pursued my undergraduate studies in Pune (the city of Maratha power) and now call it home.

Professional Journey
======
My journey into embedded systems began during my four years in college robotics, where I first encountered the magical world of microcontrollers. That discovery set the course for everything that followed.

I've worked extensively with STM32 microcontrollers, developing bare-metal libraries for core peripherals including RCC, GPIO, NVIC, I2S, UART, and SPI. For my final year project, I leveraged these libraries to develop a control system for a 4-wheeled robotic chassis—a project that solidified my passion for low-level systems programming.

My professional experience includes:
- **Knorr Bremse**: Year-long internship at the Embedded R&D department of this renowned German automotive supplier
- **Vicharak**: Brief stint gaining startup experience
- **Tor.ai**: Current role as a firmware engineer, working on Industrial IoT solutions

Technical Interests
======
My curiosity spans across multiple domains in computing and electronics:
- Computer Architecture
- Computer Networking
- Embedded Systems
- Electronics
- Control Systems

Beyond Code
======
When I'm not writing firmware or debugging hardware, you'll find me:
- 🎸 Playing the guitar
- ⚽ Supporting Manchester United through thick and thin
- 🏏 Reminiscing about my days as a club cricketer
- 🥋 Practicing karate (First Dan black belt)
- 🏓 Playing table tennis
